Microsoft DOS edit command


About edit
The MS-DOS text editor, edit, allows you to view, create, or modify any text file on your computer. 
When running edit, a screen similar to the picture below is shown.


Availability
Edit is an external command available in the below Microsoft operating systems.

MS-DOS 5.x and above
Windows 95
Windows 98
Windows ME
Windows NT
Windows 2000 (32-bit)
Windows XP (32-bit)
Windows Vista (32-bit)
Windows 7 (32-bit)

Note: The edit command is a legacy 16-bit program, which is incompatible with 64-bit operating systems. 
Therefore 64-bit versions of Windows do not come installed with, and cannot run, the edit command. 
On 64-bit Windows systems, use Notepad to edit files instead.

Syntax
EDIT [/B] [/H] [/R] [/S] [/<nnn>] [/?] [FileName...]
/B	Forces monochrome mode.
/H	Displays the maximum number of lines possible for your hardware.
/R	Load file(s) in read-only mode.
/S	Forces the use of short file names.
/<nnn>	Load binary file(s), wrapping lines to <nnn> characters wide.
/?	Display a summary of command line options.
[FileName...]	Specifies initial files(s) to load. Wildcards and multiple file specs can be given.



Edit examples
edit c:\autoexec.bat
Open the file c:\autoexec.bat to be edited, if it exists. If the file does not exist, a blank blue 
screen is shown.

Note: If you are using new versions of Windows running under a 64-bit processor the edit command no longer works. 

Using "copy con"
If you are running an MS-DOS version 4.x or lower or you cannot find edit.com on your hard drive, 
you can also use the following command to create a file.

copy con FileName
Once you have entered the above command, a file with the name specified is created.

Once you have typed all the lines you want to be in the file, press and hold Ctrl+Z. 
Once you see "^Z" on the screen, press Enter and one file should be copied.

Using edit to create a new file
Using edit, you can also create a new file. For example, if you wanted to create a file called myfile.txt, 
you would type the command below.

edit myfile.txt
This command would bring up a blank edit screen. Type your text and save the file, and myfile.txt 
will be created with the text you entered.

Additional information

Edit is only able to open a file with a maximum of 65,280 lines.
If your mouse drivers are not loaded while in MS-DOS or the Windows command line, you may have no mouse 
support. It is still possible to navigate the Editor using shortcut keys as seen in the below list.

Pressing Alt allows you to quickly navigate through edit without having to memorize all the commands listed below.
